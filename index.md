# Description

Learn and explore the fascinating world of computer programming. The goal of
the course is to help students develop programming, mathematical and
problem-solving skills. The course may also inspire some students to choose
programming as their future career.

By the end of the course, a student is expected

1. to analyze simple daily work processes
2. to see automation possibilities in the process or their parts
3. to describe the problem and its desired solution using specification of the
   software requirements
4. to implement solutions to simple problems.

# Overview

The course covers the following topics and more:

 * introduction to computers
 * file and directory manipulation
 * version control systems
 * the structure of a program
 * control structures
 * basic data types and structures
 * functions
 * modules
 * software testing
 * binary logic
 * sets
 * machine representation of data structures
 * input/output interfaces
 * files and file systems
 * databases
 * command line interfaces
 * software development models
 * documentation
 * algorithm complexity
 * machine learning
 * security
 * web applications
 * user intefaces
 * mobile development
 * cross compilation

During the course we will use [the Go programming language](https://golang.org)
as a tool to teach programming concepts.
